## About

I came to life in a quite town of Bangi , Malaysia. I am the youngest out of three siblings, but looks like the oldest. I started my education in University Teknologi Petronas in 2009. However, at that time, I am not exposed to programming, and thus decided to major in Mechanical Engineering. Fast forward 6 years later, I started a job in the construction industry as an engineer, while also studying for coding by myself. A year later, I decided to quit my job and join a coding bootcamp to learn seriously how to develop a website. Here I am today, trying to make the best website for my customer. However, the learning never ends. The more I know, the more I realize what I dont know.

And I love it
