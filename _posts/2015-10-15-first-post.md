First post!!
Its been about 5 month since I quit my last job. Since then, I have no job, no income, go back to stay with my parents, less shopping, spend money on attending programming bootcamp, more money for resources on programming. Im basically broke right now. Good thing I dont have much commitment and had quite a lot of saving(not much now).

Did I regret it?

### Hell no!!

Hello programming world!
