Whether you like it or not, if you're going to be a web developer(front-end especially) you have to know Javascript. 
It can be said as the current de-facto lingua franca of web programming. New language or framework that is based on javasript 
pop out left and right. The current hotstuff in javascript is of course React.js, Anguar.js, and Ember.js. 
We never know though what the future holds for these frameworks, since the web programming realm move at a really fast pace.
Here is some of my favourite resource for learning Javascript
